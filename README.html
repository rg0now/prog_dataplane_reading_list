<i>The Programmable Data Plane Reading list has been permanently moved to its new home <a href="https://programmabledataplane.review">programmabledataplane.review</a>. This repo is no longer maintained, please direct your pull requests to the new <a href="https://github.com/programmabledataplanereview/programmabledataplanereview.github.io">github repo</a>.</i>
</p>

<p>
This is a reading list for students, practitioners, and researchers
interested in the general area of programmable data plane devices. Topics
include SmartNICs, programmable middleboxes and software/hardware switches,
that is, everything that may underlie a software-defined network, with only
a marginal attention to the major application areas like Network Function
Virtualization, service chaining, or 5G.
</p>

<p>
The reading list completes the survey paper:
</p>

<p>
Roberto Bifulco and Gábor Rétvári:
<a href="https://rg0now.github.io/prog_dataplane_reading_list/2018_HPSR.pdf">A Survey on the Programmable Data Plane: Abstractions, Architectures, and Open Problems</a>,
in <i>IEEE HPSR</i>, 2018.
</p>

<p>
The reading list is organized into a rough hierarchy based on the major
topics of <i>Abstractions</i>, <i>Architecture</i>, <i>Applications</i>, and
<i>Miscellanea</i>; note that this hierarchy is more or less arbitrary and the
purpose is just to have <i>some</i> organization at all. The individual papers
are tagged as "mustread", "important", and "interesting" (available only in
the HTML version), with the approximate meaning "read at least these papers
to get a good understanding of the area", "papers for getting more familiar
with some sub-areas", and "interesting contributions to the field",
respectively. Just like the hierarchy, the tags are also pretty much
arbitrary and follow the subjective view of the authors; as always, your
mileage may vary.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> Some of the linked papers are behind paywalls. We double-checked
that all listed papers can be accessed freely by a moderate amount of
googling; we still provide the paywall links as user-provided PDFs often do
not prove overly stable over time.

<h2 id="org97c2d2b">Abstractions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org97c2d2b">
<p>
At the heart of programmable data planes lies the question of which
abstractions and programming interfaces to provide.  We first review
literature on low-level APIs, including OpenFlow and P4, and then discuss
more high-level languages and compilers, including DevoFlow and the
Frenetic framework. Particular focus is put on stateful abstractions.  We
then extend our review to literature on parser design as well as
scheduling, and in particular, the question whether there exist universal
packet scheduling algorithms.

We start our survey with the seminal paper on OpenFlow, introducing a
standardized interface to manage flow table entries in data plane devices
via a standard control-plane&#x2013;data-plane API. We then proceed by discussing
P4 and its alternatives and use cases. We also review, among other,
high-performance packet processing languages and make the case for
intermediate representations for programmable data planes.
</p>

<p>
We then proceed to more high-level languages and abstractions, discuss
programming languages such as Pyretic, systems such as Maple, or novel
switch designs like HARMLESS to seamlessly add SDN capability to legacy
network gear.

The OpenFlow whitepaper. The original idea in OpenFlow was to provide a way
for researchers to run experimental protocols in the networks they use
every day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal
flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries.
This allowed, in addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas
in real-world traffic settings, for OpenFlow to serve as a useful campus
component in large-scale testbeds.

This paper describes a model which combines a parallel model and
heterogeneous multiprocessor implementations.  The parallel packet
processing model uses coarse-grained SPMD parallelism to free users from
thread management and it requires the host system to locate protocol
headers in the packet before a parallel copy of the program executes.  The
packetC language abstracts and encapsulates familiar packet processing data
sets and operations into new aggregate data types and operators, e.g., for
packets, databases and searchsets.

As an alternative to P4, Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF) is presented
as a key enabler for highly flexible and programmable SDN. The goal is to
remove any dependency on protocol-specific configurations on the forwarding
elements and, in addition to P4's stateless design, enhance the data-path
with new stateful instructions to support genuine software defined
networking behavior. A generic flow instruction set (FIS) is defined to
fulfill this purpose and both hardware-based and open source software-based
prototypes are shown to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of POF.

This seminal paper introduces P4, a high-level language for programming
protocol-independent packet processors. P4 has three goals: (1)
reconfigurability, in that programmers can change the way switches process
packets once they are deployed, (2) protocol independence, in that switches
are not tied to any specific network protocols, and (3) target
independence, in that programmers can describe packet-processing
functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying
hardware. The paper demonstrates P4 by showing configure a switch to add a
new hierarchical label.

The paper presents a case study that uses P4 to express the forwarding behavior
of a datacenter switch's data plane. In the process, it identifies issues and
strengths of P4. Some of the lessons learned had, and are having, an impact on
the language evolution. For instance, and most notably, the
language-architecture separation that has been implemented in newer versions of
P4.

The paper introduces NetASM, an intermediate representation for
programmable data planes. NetASM is a device-independent language that is
expressive enough to act as the target language for compilers for
high-level languages, yet low-level enough to be efficiently assembled on
various device architectures. It enables conventional compiler optimization
techniques to significantly improve the performance and resource
utilization of custom packet-processing pipelines on a variety of targets.

The paper proposes an API for programming the generation of packets in
programmable switches, instead of forging network packets on the controller
side.  The InSP API allows a programmer to define in-switch packet
generation operations, which include the specification of triggering
conditions, packet's content and forwarding actions.

PVPP is a data-plane program compiler from P4, a data plane DSL based on
match-action tables, to the fd.io Vector Packet Processor (VPP) software
switch, based on the packet processing node graph model. PVPP compiles a
data plane program written in P4 to VPP's internal graph

This paper is motivated by the observation that OpenFlow, in its original
design, imposes great overheads, involving the switch’s control-plane too
often.  In order to meet the needs of high-performance networks, the
authors propose and evaluate DevoFlow, which provides less fine-grained
visibility, at significantly lower costs. In a case study, the authors show
that DevoFlow can load-balance data center traffic as well as fine-grained
solutions, but with much fewer flow table entries and using much fewer
control messages.

The paper introduces Pyretic, a novel programming language for writing
composable SDN applications using a set of high level topology and
packet-processing abstractions. Pyretic improves on Frenetic (an earlier
incarnation of a similar language) by adding support for sequential
composition, the use of topology abstractions to define what each module
can see and do with the network, and an abstract packet model that
introduces virtual fields into packets. Modular applications are written
using the static policy language NetCore, which provides primitive actions,
matching predicates, query policies, and policies.

The paper presents Maple, a system that simplifies SDN programming by (1)
allowing a programmer to use a standard programming language to design an
arbitrary, centralized algorithm, to decide the behavior of an entire
network, and (2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined,
centralized policy runs on every packet entering a network, and hence is
oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into sets of
rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic policies
efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore
scheduler, but more importantly a novel tracing runtime optimizer that can
automatically record reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches
when possible, and keep switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically
tracing the dependency of policy decisions on packet contents as well as
the environment.

The paper contributes just what is stated in the title, a new network
programming language called NetKAT that is based on a solid
mathematical foundation. Formerly, the design of network dataplane
programming languages was largely ad hoc, driven more by the needs of
applications and the capabilities of network hardware than by
foundational principles.  NetKAT solves this problem by (1) proposing
primitives for filtering, modifying, and transmitting packets,
operators for combining programs in parallel and in sequence, and a
Kleene star operator for iteration, and (2) presenting a series of
proofs that the language is sound and complete.

This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level
language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run
on programmable line-rate switching chips. The key challenge is that many
data-plane algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. To achieve
line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms, the paper introduces the
notion of a packet transaction: a sequential packet-processing code block
that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. The idea is
developed in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane
algorithms, and many examples are shown that can be run at line rate with
modest estimated chip-area overhead.

Similarly to the "Universal Packet Scheduling" paper, this paper presents
another design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling
algorithms, potentially algorithms that are unknown today, to be programmed
into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.  The design uses the
property that scheduling algorithms make two decisions, in what order to
schedule packets and when to schedule them, and exploits that in many
scheduling algorithms definitive decisions on these two questions can be
made when packets are enqueued. The resultant design uses a single
abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that
maintains the scheduling order or time.

the ability to maintain mutable state inside switches to achieve fair
bandwidth allocation across all traversing flows. The problem is that
implementing fair queuing mechanisms in high-speed switches is expensive,
since they require complex flow classification, buffer allocation, and
scheduling on a per-packet basis. The proposed dequeuing scheduler, called
Rotating Strict Priority scheduler, simulates an ideal round-robin scheme
where each active flow transmits a single bit of data in every round, which
allows to transmit packets from multiple queues in approximately sorted
order.

The trend toward increasing link speeds and slowdown in the scaling of
CPU speeds, leads to a situation where packet scheduling in software
results in lower precision and higher CPU utilization.  While by
offloading packet scheduling to the hardware (e.g., the NIC), this
drawback can be overcome, one still would like to retain the
flexibility benefits of software packet schedulers: packet scheduling
in hardware should hence be programmable.  Shrivastav proposes a
generalization of the Push-In-First-Out (PIFO) primitive used by
state-of-the-art hardware packet schedulers: Push-In-Extract-Out
(PIEO) maintains an ordered list of elements, but allows dequeue from
arbitrary positions in the list by supporting a programmable
predicate-based filtering at dequeue.  PIEO supports most scheduling
(work-conserving and non-work conserving) algorithms and can be
implemented scalably in hardware.

The authors argue that, instead of enforcing the same universal fast-path

as it is done in Open vSwitch, a programmable software switch should rather
automatically specialize its dataplane piecemeal with respect to the
configured workload. They introduce ESwitch, a switch architecture that
uses on-the-fly template-based code generation to compile any OpenFlow
pipeline into efficient machine code, which can then be readily used as the
switch fast-path, delivering superior packet processing speed, improved
latency and CPU scalability, and predictable performance.

The paper makes the observation that data-plane compilation is
fundamentally static, i.e., the input of the compiler is a fixed
description of the forwarding plane semantics and the output is code that
can accommodate any packet processing behavior set by the controller at
runtime. The authors advocate a dynamic approach to data plane compilation
instead, where not just the semantics but the intended behavior is
also input to the compiler, opening the door to a handful of runtime
optimization opportunities that can be leveraged to improve the performance
of custom-compiled datapaths beyond what is possible in a static setting.

The paper is motivated by the challenges involved in consistent updates of
distributed network configurations, given the complexity of modern switch
datapaths and the exposed opaque configuration mechanisms.  The authors
demonstrate that even simple rule updates result in inconsistent packet
switching in multi-table datapaths.  The main contribution of the paper is
a hardware design that supports a transactional configuration mechanism,
providing strong switch-level atomicity: all packets traversing the
datapath will encounter either the old configuration or the new one, and
never an inconsistent mix of the two. The approach is prototyped using the
NetFPGA hardware platform.

A follow-up to the RMT paper. dRMT (disaggregated Reconfigurable
Match-Action Table) is a new architecture for programmable switches, which
overcomes two important restrictions of RMT: (1) table memory is local to
an RMT pipeline stage, implying that memory not used by one stage cannot be
reclaimed by another, and (2) RMT is hardwired to always sequentially
execute matches followed by actions as packets traverse pipeline
stages. dRMT resolves both issues by disaggregating the memory and compute
resources of a programmable switch, moving table memories out of pipeline
stages and into a centralized pool that is accessible through a
crossbar. In addition, dRMT replaces RMT's pipeline stages with a cluster
of processors that can execute match and action operations in any order.

The authors ask what switch hardware primitives are required to support an
expressive language of network performance questions. They present a
performance query language, Marple, modeled on familiar functional
constructs, backed by a new programmable key-value store primitive on
switch hardware that performs flexible aggregations at line rate and scales
to millions of keys. Marple can express switch queries that could
previously run only on end hosts, while Marple queries only occupy a modest

This is the answer to the question raised by the "Raising the Bar for Using
GPUs" paper.  Kalia et al. argue that the key enabler for high
packet-processing performance is the inherent feature of GPU that
automatically hides memory access latency rather than its parallel
computation power and claim that CPU can outperform or achieve a similar
performance as GPU if its code is re-arranged to run concurrently with
memory access. This paper revists these claims and find, with eight popular
algorithms widely used in network applications, that (a) there are many
compute-bound algorithms that do benefit from the parallel computation
capacity of GPU while CPU-based optimizations fail to help, and (b) the
relative performance advantage of CPU over GPU in most applications is due
to data transfer bottleneck in PCIe communication of discrete GPU rather
than lack of capacity of GPU itself.

isolation breakdown and to enforce it when necessary: CPU-fair

This paper presents the packet classifier algorithm that underlies the Open
vSwitch fast-path. Packet classification requires matching each packet
against a database of flow rules and forwarding the packet according to the
highest priority rule. The paper introduces a generic packet classification
algorithm, called Tuple Space Search (TSS), based on the observation that
real databases typically use only a small number of distinct field lengths.
Thus, by mapping rules to tuples even a simple linear search of the tuple
space can provide significant speedup over naive linear search over the
filters. Each tuple is maintained as a hash table that can be searched in
one memory access.

Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have become the industrial
standard for high-throughput packet classification, and as such, for
programmable switch ASICs. However, one major drawback of TCAMs is their
high power consumption. In this paper, a practical and efficient solution
is proposed which introduces a smart pre-classifier to reduce power
consumption of TCAMs for multi-dimensional packet classification. The
classifier dimension is reduced by pre-classifying a packet on two header
fields, source and destination IP addresses. Then, the high dimensional
problem can use only a small portion of a TCAM for a given packet. The
pre-classifier is built such that a given packet matches at most one entry
in the pre-classifier, and each rule is stored only once in one of the TCAM
blocks, which avoids rule replication. The presented solution uses
commodity TCAMs.

The authors argue that a hybrid software-hardware switch may help in

builds on two key observations. First, software tables are very fast to be
updated, hence, forwarding tables updates always happen in software first
and, eventually, entries are moved to the TCAM to achieve higher overall
throughput and offload the software forwarder. Lookup in software is
performed only in case there are no entries matching a packet in
hardware. Second, since deleting entries from TCAM is much faster than
adding them, ShadowSwitch may translate an entry installation in a mix of
installation in software tables and deletion from hardware tables.

<p>
A main motivation for programmable data planes are the novel applications
they enable.  We identify and, in the following, will discuss five main
categories: applications related to resilient and efficient forwarding,
in-network computation, consensus, telemetry, and load-balancing.
</p>

<p>
One may wonder, what aspects of SDN and programmable data plane make these
applications possible?  There is probably no single perfect answer to this
question.
</p>

<p>
Applications related to in-network computation typically leverage new
hardware-assisted primitive operations, supported in the data plane, to
provide novel functionality and improve performance.  Resilient and
efficient routing (and to some extent load-balancing) leverage the unique
and unprecedented programmatic control over the way traffic flows through
the network, e.g., to implement advanced functionality in the data plane
(whereas formerly it used to be handled, e.g., in the control plane).
Measurement applications benefit from the improved traffic visibility
and/or from the improved latency and throughput at which high-volume and
highly variable traffic can be handled, if offloaded to the data plane.
Reduced latency and improved reaction time is arguably also a key reason
for consensus applications.  Furthermore, measurement applications benefit
from the fact that they can be expressed in terms of simple primitives
(e.g., sketches).  We also note that such applications are not limited to
be "performed (only) in the network": for example, telemetry can (and
today often does) occur outside the network. That said, telemetry
applications also benefit from the new visibility into the network, e.g.,
queues occupation levels of the switches along the path.  Many interesting
applications also arise from offloading applications that were formerly
handled in a separate middlebox to programmable switches.
</p>

<p>
In general, any application designed for a non-programmable device may
benefit from the flexibilities introduced by a programmable counterpart
(e.g., allowing to evolve the application).  Also, applications with a
strong networking component (e.g., request-response patterns) are more
likely to benefit from in-network services, as much communication traffic
naturally traverses the network anyway.

non-conflicting routes accordingly. The authors show that the more global

switch-local schedulers cannot, and to adaptively schedule the switching
fabric in a way which significantly improves aggregate network utilization

The authors propose to move the responsibility for maintaining basic
network connectivity (as opposed to the computation of optimal paths which
require global control plane knowledge) to the data plane, which operates
orders of magnitude faster than the control plane.  Their Data-Driven
Connectivity (DDC) approach, which can handle arbitrary delays and losses,
relies on simple state changes which can done at packet rates.  In
particular, DCC relies on link reversal routing, adapted to suit the data
plane, e.g., to handle message loss.

The paper explores new possibilities, created by programmable
switches, for fast dataplane-driven rerouting upon signals triggered
by traffic disruptions. The proposed method, Blink, uses exploits
TCP-induced signals to detect failures; when compounded over multiple
flows, TCP behavior creates a strong and characteristic failure
signal. Blink analyzes TCP flows, at line rate, to reliably and
quickly detect major traffic disruptions and recover data-plane
connectivity.  Evaluation results on a P4 implementation of Blink
running on real Tofino switch indicate that it can achieve sub-second
rerouting for realistic Internet traffic and scales to protect large
fractions of realistic traffic.

This paper makes the case that many massive-scale information processing

from the network edge into the network.  This is because in many of these
applications data is aggregated during the computation process and the
output size is a fraction of the input size. The authors explore a
different point in the design space, whereby instead of increasing the
network bandwidth they rather implement a MapReduce-like system on a
cluster design that uses a direct-connect network topology, with servers
directly linked to other servers, and letting servers to perform in-network
aggregation of data during the shuffle phase. Camdoop was shown to

The main contribution of this work is providing a set of general building
blocks that mask the limitations of programmable switches (limited state,
support limited types of operations, limited per-packet computation) using
approximation techniques and thereby enabling the implementation of
realistic network protocols. These building blocks are then used to tackle
the network resource allocation problem within datacenters and realize
approximate variants of congestion control and load balancing protocols,
such as XCP, RCP, and CONGA, that require explicit support from the
network. The evaluations show that the proposed approximations are accurate
and that they do not exceed the hardware resource limits associated with
flexible switches.

advent of programmable switch ASICs, which can run complex logic at
line rate, the paper revisits this principle, by accelerating the
control plane offloading some of its tasks directly to the network
hardware. Some simple control plane functionality can already be
successfully offloaded to P4 hardware, including failure detection and
notification, connectivity retrieval, and even policy-based routing
protocols, but complex cases involve several tradeoffs and
limitations; the paper outlines these and sketches interesting future
research directions towards hardware-software co-design of network
control planes.

Current implementations of time synchronization protocols, like PTP,
handle the protocol stack in the control-plane. The paper explores the
possibility of using programmable switching ASICs to design and
implement a time synchronization protocol, DPTP, with the core logic
running in the data-plane. Comprehensive measurement studies running a
a dataplane-accelerated DPTP implemented in P4 running on a Barefoot
Tofino switch shows that DPTP can achieve median and 99th percentile
synchronization error of 19 ns and 47 ns, even under heavy network
load.

One intellectual precursor to programmable networks is the Active Networks
concept. This paper surveys the application of active networks technology
to network management and monitoring. The main idea of Smart Packets, which
contain programs written in a safe language, is to move management decision
points closer to the nodes being managed, as well as to target specific
aspects of the node for information.

A seminal paper for deploying SDN in enterprise networks, this paper
presents Ethane, a network architecture allowing managers to define a
single network-wide fine-grain policy and then enforcing it
directly. Ethane couples extremely simple flow-based Ethernet switches with
a centralized controller that manages the admittance and routing of
flows. While radical, this design is backwards-compatible with existing
hosts and switches.  Ethane was implemented in both hardware and software,
supporting both wired and wireless hosts.

SoftCell aims to overcome today's expensive, inflexible and complex
cellular core networks by supporting fine-grained policies for mobile
devices, using commodity switches and servers.  In particular, SoftCell
allows to flexibly route traffic through sequences of middleboxes based on
subscriber attributes and applications.  Scalability is achieved by
minimizing the size of the forwarding tables, using aggregation, and by
performing packet classification at the access switches, next to the base
stations.

The paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of B4, a
private WAN connecting Google's data centers across the planet. B4 has a
number of unique characteristics: (1) massive bandwidth requirements
deployed to a modest number of sites, (2) elastic traffic demand that seeks
to maximize average bandwidth, and (3) full control over the edge servers
and network, which enables rate limiting and demand measurement at the
edge. These characteristics led to a Software Defined Networking architecture
using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant
silicon.

To support deploying SDNs into the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), the paper
presents the design and evaluation of a system architecture for a software
EPC that achieves high and scalable performance. The authors postulate that
the poor scaling of existing EPC systems stems from the manner in which the
system is decomposed, which leads to device state being duplicated across
multiple components, which in turn results in frequent interactions between
the different components. An alternate approach is proposed in which state
for a single device is consolidated in one location and EPC functions are
reorganized for efficient access to this consolidated state. A prototype
for PEPC is also presented, as a software EPC that implements the key
components of the design.
